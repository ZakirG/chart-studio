Leap: Hiring Project #3

Hiring Partner Project Brief

Project Title
AI-First CRM Reporting & Dashboard Platform
Project Category
Category A: AI-First DevelopmentBuild a flexible, modern reporting platform using AI-assisted development practices. Focus on building beautiful dashboards and extensible, intuitive data exploration functionality, leveraging existing SQL queries and schema metadata provided.
--------------------
Problem Statement
Our CRM platform is used daily by contractors to manage leads, jobs, appointments, documents, payments, commissions, and more. While we have a large library of legacy reports, they are difficult to extend, poorly presented, and lack the flexibility modern operators expect.
We need a modern reporting experience for our CRM product, leveraging our existing MySQL database and SQL logic. This new reporting UI should provide insight into operational performance, sales, payments, scheduling, and employee activity in a way that is clear, customizable, and delightful.
--------------------
Business Context & Impact
This will replace our outdated in-app reporting module, creating a foundation for analytics that internal users and our customers can trust and build on.
Key Goals:
• Avoid requiring deep knowledge of our data model (600+ tables)
• Provide attractive, flexible dashboards out of the box
• Use existing SQL definitions provided by our dev team
• Minimize time spent reverse engineering or cleaning data
Business Impact:
• Faster insight delivery to customers and internal stakeholders
• Easier access to standard KPIs and operational data
• Platform extensibility for future custom reporting needs
